# EMS-SymINSGNSS
This software package is a simple basic demonstration of EMS symbolic 
engine for modelling and integrating dynamic systems that uses multiple sensors. 
This is a basic INS/GNSS loosely-coupled system using EKF.
This is only a DEMO with basic updates (position/velocity) are applied
More advanced updates such as nonholonomic constraints, zero-speed, and
adaptive EKF are NOT implemented in this DEMO. The purpose of the DEMO 
is to demonstrate the basics of EKF in a basic INS/GNSS fusion scenario
